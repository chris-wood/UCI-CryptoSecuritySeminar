<p>
Security and Privacy Research OUTfit (SPROUT) is a group of people (faculty, students, visitors) who enjoy the exciting, rewarding, treacherous and slightly paranoid world of research in applied cryptography, computer/network security and privacy. Research directions/projects are broadly scoped, ranging from cryptographic protocols to usable security and privacy.
